File Handling
2 types of files
- text
- binary / bytes - images, audio, video...

2 types of operations
- read
- write

Steps to perform file handling
- open file and tell the mode in which we are going to open file
- read/write data
- close file

modes for file handling
- read		- r / rb
- write		- w / wb / x
- append	- a / ab

Difference b/w 'x' mode and 'w' mode
- 'w' mode open file for write, if file already exists than it overwrites the file. If file doesn't exist than it will create the file and than write it...

- 'x' mode open file for write, if file already exists than it raise an error file already exist. It will creates the file first.
